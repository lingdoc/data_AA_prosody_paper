## Praat file data for Austroasiatic prosody

This repository contains sound files annotated with Praat TextGrids. The goal of the repository is to provide data and annotations for other researchers who wish to verify, replicate, or extend the research reported of the original authors. It currently contains subfolders with recordings of stories in three Austroasiatic languages (WAV format) annotated with a TextGrid of two tiers. The first tier contains words annotated with a number representing the number of syllables. The second tier contains transcriptions of the sentences in IPA or local Roman orthography. This folder additionally contains a `metadata.txt` file that gives language and speaker information for each recording, as well as a short description of the story being told. The paper related to this data can be cited as:
