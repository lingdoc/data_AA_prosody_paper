## Praat files: data for Austroasiatic prosody

This repository primarily contains sound files annotated with Praat TextGrids, along with images made from selections of these soundfiles and TextGrids that are used in the paper cited below. The goal of the repository is to provide data and annotations for other researchers who wish to verify, replicate, or extend the research of the original authors.

There are currently three subfolders in this repository (one for each Austroasiatic language investigated) which each contain an `images` folder and a recording of a story in the respective language (WAV format) annotated with a TextGrid of two tiers. The first tier in each TextGrid contains words annotated with a number representing the number of syllables. The second tier contains transcriptions of the sentences in IPA or local Roman orthography.

This folder additionally contains a `metadata.txt` file that gives language and speaker information for each recording, as well as a short description of the story being told. The paper related to this data can be cited as:
